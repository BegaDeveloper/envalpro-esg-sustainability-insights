## üíª My Role & Contributions

I served as the **Team Lead and Software Architect** for the EnvalPro project ‚Äî overseeing the architecture, development flow, and implementation strategy across both the frontend and backend teams.
In addition to leading the team, I also contributed directly to the **frontend (Angular)** and coordinated **integration between the FastAPI backend and GCP services**.

Key leadership and technical contributions:

* Designed the **full system architecture**, defining communication patterns between Angular and FastAPI.
* Led a cross-functional team of frontend, backend, and data engineers, ensuring efficient collaboration.
* Developed **Angular modules and reusable components** for dashboards, charts, and report generation.
* Designed the **FastAPI endpoints** and data structures for ESG scoring, renovation cost estimation, and property modeling.
* Integrated **Google Cloud AI services** for environmental data analysis and automated recommendations.
* Established **code standards, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment strategies** on GCP.
* Ensured alignment with **ESG and EU data security requirements**, including GDPR compliance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Technical Highlights I Implemented

### üß© 1. ESG Scoring & Cost Modeling Engine (FastAPI)

Led the backend architecture for a **dynamic ESG scoring algorithm** that combines sustainability metrics with renovation cost estimation.

Implemented:

* Weighted scoring model evaluating **E (environmental)**, **S (social)**, and **G (governance)** pillars.
* Cost prediction using **linear regression** and **domain-based heuristics** for renovation types (energy efficiency, insulation, solar installations, etc.).
* RESTful endpoints exposing ESG reports and cost breakdowns to the Angular frontend.

```python
@app.post("/esg/score")
def calculate_esg_score(data: ESGInput):
    env_score = model_env.predict(data.env_factors)
    soc_score = model_soc.predict(data.soc_factors)
    gov_score = model_gov.predict(data.gov_factors)
    cost_estimate = renovation_model.predict(data.property_features)
    return {"esg_score": (env_score + soc_score + gov_score) / 3, "cost_estimate": cost_estimate}
```

This engine powered all sustainability insights displayed in the frontend dashboard.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Angular ESG Dashboard Architecture

Architected a **modular Angular app** that allows users to visualize sustainability data interactively:

* Used **RxJS Observables and NgRx-like state management** for real-time updates.
* Integrated **Angular Material charts and D3.js visualizations** for ESG indicators and cost trends.
* Developed **filter panels, scorecards, and map overlays** for property-based insights.
* Built a **PDF report generator** that exports ESG summaries for clients and auditors.

The frontend was optimized for responsiveness and clarity, providing executives and ESG managers with an intuitive decision interface.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Integration & Cloud Infrastructure (GCP)

* Deployed both Angular and FastAPI services on **Google Cloud App Engine**.
* Used **Cloud Functions** for asynchronous tasks like report generation and model training.
* Configured **Cloud Storage** for storing uploaded documents, energy reports, and result datasets.
* Implemented **GCP logging and monitoring** for uptime and performance tracking.

This setup ensured scalability, low latency, and compliance with data privacy laws in the EU.

## üß© What We Built

* **ESG Scoring Engine** ‚Äì Evaluates environmental, social, and governance performance dynamically.
* **Renovation Cost Predictor** ‚Äì Estimates upgrade costs based on property type, size, and energy rating.
* **Interactive Analytics Dashboard** ‚Äì Displays scores, trends, and recommendations.
* **PDF Report Generator** ‚Äì Creates exportable sustainability and compliance reports.
* **Team Collaboration Tools** ‚Äì Role-based dashboards for analysts, managers, and auditors.

## üèÅ Outcome

EnvalPro became a **leading ESG evaluation tool** used across Germany to assess sustainability performance and investment feasibility.
The platform helped clients **reduce analysis time by 60%**, **improve ESG compliance visibility**, and **quantify renovation impacts** with precision.

As the **Software Architect and Team Lead**, I successfully delivered a production-grade system that combines **environmental intelligence with financial analytics**, setting a new standard for ESG decision support tools.
